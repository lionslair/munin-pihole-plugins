Or let "munin-node-configure --shell | bash" do it for you.

# Configuration
* Edit the exiting `plugins.conf` file

Sample setup for '/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf'
```
[pihole_*]
    user root
    env.host 192.168.1.123
    env.port 80
    env.api /admin/api.php
```

* Or download the example configuration from this repo:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/master/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf -P /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d
```

Note: It's assumed you'll edit the `env.host` value to properly reflect the host.
