# Configuration
* Edit the exiting `plugins.conf` file

Sample setup for '/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf'
```
[pihole_*]
    user root
    env.host 192.168.1.123
    env.port 80
    env.api /admin/api.php
```

* Or download the example configuration from this repo:
```

```
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/master/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf
