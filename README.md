* Restart Munin services

## Configuration

Provided munin-node and Pi-hole exist on the same host, the default configuration should Just Work. If you have a non-standard configuration or Pi-hole is running on a seperate host, you can do one of the following.

* Sample setup for `/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pihole`
```
[pihole_*]
    user root
    env.host 127.0.0.1
    env.port 80
    env.api /admin/api.php
    env.cachesuffix ?getCacheInfo&auth=
    env.webpassword PIHOLE_SETUPVARS_WEBPASSWORD_HERE
```

* Download and edit a sample `/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/unbound` file from this repo:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/master/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pihole -P /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d
```
The `env.webpassword` value can be obtained from the Pihole host's `/etc/pihole/setupVars.conf` file. The plugin attempts to obtain this value itself.

Graphs should be generated at five minute intervals. If you still do not see graphs after this time, try restarting the machine and waiting a further five minutes. If you still can not get any graphs to display, contact me for further support.
