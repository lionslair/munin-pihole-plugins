* Restart Munin services

## Configuration

Provided munin-node and Pi-hole exist on the same host, the default configuration should Just Work. If you have a non-standard configuration or Pi-hole is running on a seperate host, you can do one of the following.

* Sample setup for `/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pihole`
```
[pihole_*]
    user root
    env.host 127.0.0.1
    env.port 80
    env.api /admin/api.php
    env.cachesuffix ?getCacheInfo&auth=
    env.webpassword PIHOLE_SETUPVARS_WEBPASSWORD_HERE
```

* Download and edit a sample `/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/unbound` file from this repo:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/munin-pihole-plugins/master/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pihole -P /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d
```
The `env.webpassword` value can be obtained from the Pihole host's `/etc/pihole/setupVars.conf` file. The plugin attempts to obtain this value itself.

## Help! My graphs aren't showing up!

* Be patient

Graphs should be generated at five minute intervals. If you still do not see graphs after this time, try restarting the machine and waiting a further five minutes. If you still can not get any graphs to display, contact me for further support.
